# CyberSecurityProject

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio. This repository contains a collection of my work in cryptography and system security, highlighting both theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation.

## Contents

### Cryptography Projects

This section includes classical encryption and decryption techniques:

- **Caesar Cipher**: Implements character-shifting encryption and decryption.
- **Vigen√®re Cipher**: A polyalphabetic cipher using a keyword for encryption.
- **Affine Cipher**: A cipher based on mathematical modular arithmetic.
- **Additional Ciphers**: Other cryptographic techniques explored and analyzed.

### System Security Projects

This section demonstrates common vulnerabilities found in web applications and how they can be exploited or mitigated:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Examples of XSS attacks and their prevention.
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Demonstrates how unsanitized input can be exploited in SQL queries.
- **Other Vulnerabilities**: Includes explorations of CSRF, authentication flaws, and input validation issues.

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to build practical skills in cybersecurity by exploring both classic cryptographic methods and modern web security vulnerabilities. Each section includes source code and documentation that explains the concept, how it works, and how to defend against it.
